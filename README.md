# SalesTaxCalculator Project

## Overview
A C program designed to calculate the total bill amount for a series of products, including the application of sales tax. Users input product names (as single characters), prices, and quantities, and the program computes subtotals, a cumulative total, and the final amount payable after tax.

## Features
- User input for product names, prices, and quantities.
- Calculation of subtotals for each product.
- Application of a 5% sales tax to the total amount.
- Display of detailed billing information.

## Installation
1. Ensure a C compiler (like GCC) is installed on your system.
2. Download the `sales_tax_calculator.c` source file.
3. Compile the program: `gcc -o sales_tax_calculator sales_tax_calculator.c`.
4. Run the compiled executable: `./sales_tax_calculator`.

## How to Use
1. Start the program.
2. Follow the prompts to enter the number of products, and then the details (name, price, quantity) for each product.
3. Review the calculated bill, which includes subtotals for each item, total amount before tax, sales tax applied, and total amount payable.
